Make some noise for UGA Dining!</div>
<div class='div'>
<div class="d"><p><b>Are you a hungry UGA student? Do you have a mealplan?</b></p></div>
<p>If you answered <span style=font-weight:bolder>yes</span> to both of these, then this wepbage is for you! Here you will find
reviews for all the wonderful places on campus you can use your mealplan.  Use our reviews of
UGA's dining halls and restaraunts to pick the right place to grab some grub! The eateries
are evaluated by the following criteria: dining hall vs. restaraunt vs. grab and go, location, type of food, and cost. Each 
dining option is also given a (subjective) satisfaction rating on a 1-5 scale.</p>
<p>UGA has 4 main dining halls and various restaraunts scattered throughout campus. 
The 4 main dining halls are Bolton, Snelling, ECV (Joe Frank Harris) Commons, and Ogelthorpe (O-house).
Restaraunts include Chick-Fil-A, Panda Express, Niche Pizza, Barberitos, Einsteins Bagels & Coffee, 
Starbucks, a UGA Taco Truck, Jittery Joe's Coffee, Au Bon Pain, and many more! There are also express cafes featuring 
grab-and-go items and snacks made by UGA.</p>
<p>We will review here the main dining halls, the chain restaruants, the food truck,
and two of the cafe/market place shops.</P>

<table border=2>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Food Served</th>
<th>Cost</th><th>Wait Time (Min/Max)</th><th>Location</th><th>Satisfaction Rating 1(low)-5(high)/Comments</th>
<tr><td>Au Bon Pain</td><td>Restaraunt</td><td>Made-to-Order Sandwhiches and Salads, Soup, Snacks, Baked Goods</td>
<td>$5-10 (MP)</td><td>5 min/20min</td><td>Business Learning Complex</td><td>4.5: Great place to grab slighty more sophisticated French-inspired
cuisine</td></tr>
<tr><td>Barberitos</td><td>Restaraunt</td><td>Mexican: Tacos, Burritos, Nachos, Taco Salad, Quesadillas etc.</td><td>
~$10 MP</td><td>5min/30min</td><td>Tate Student Center</td><td>4.5: Excellent Mexican fast-food. Try the queso, but avoid the busy time line!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bolton</td><td>Dining Hall</td><td>All-day Breakfast, Homestyle, Italian, Chinese, Salad Bar, Grill, Bakery & Desserts</td>
<td>1 Swipe or ~$10 per access</td><td>5/20min per station</td><td>Central Campus</td><td>4: Not the best quality of Dining Halls, but good variety and location!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chick-Fil-A</td><td>Restaraunt</td><td>Breakfast (Biscuits, Hasbrowns), Chicken Sanwhiches, Nuggets, Fries, Desserts</td>
<td>$7-10 MP</td><td>5min/30min</td><td>Tate Student Center</td><td>5: Chick-Fil-A is a solid go-to.  Use the App to skip the unweildy lunch-time rush line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ECV (Joe Frank Harris)</td><td>Dining Hall</td><td>Breakfast, Italian, Grill, Sandwhich Bar, Salad Bar, Desserts</td>
<td>1 Swipe or ~$10 per access</td><td>5min/20min per station</td><td>East Campus</td><td>3.75-4: Less variety than Bolton, but similar quality. Go for the Deli and the Coffee bar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Einstein's Bagels & Coffee</td><td>Grab-and-go/Cafe</td><td>Bagels, Sandwhiches, Pizza Bagels, Salads, Snacks, Coffee Drinks, Baked Goods</td>
<td>$3-10 MP</td><td>5min/15min</td><td>Science Learning Center</td><td>4.5: Excellent if you love all things bagels. Customize any freshly toasted bagel with a cream cheese flavor of your choice. 
Bagel sandwhiches are a tasty twist on the classic lunch. The bagel mini pizzas are also a tasty non-conventional choice. Also, short line!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jittery Joe's</td><td>Grab-and-go/Cafe</td><td>Coffee Drinks, Baked Goods, Bagels, Cold Drinks</td><td>$3-5</td>
<td>5min/10min</td><td>Miller Learning Center, Science Library</td><td>3: Doesn't accept meal plan dollars and not as good as Starbucks. Go to Starbucks if you can!</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Niche Pizza Co</td><td>Restaraunt</td><td>Italian Food: Pizza, Hoagies, Cold Drinks, Gelato</td><td>~$10 MP</td><td>20min/35min</td><td>Tate Stduent Center</td><td>4.5: Excellent custom pizzas and gelato!
Wait times are higher in general to allow for pizzas to be cooked traditional style in a brick oven.  Pizzas are large for one person, so buy one to share or save it for later!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Market at Tate</td><td>Grab-and-go/Convienence</td><td>Grab-and-go Sandwhich/Salad/Snacks, Frozen Meals, Candy, Baked Goods, Convienence Items, etc.</td>
<td>$5-10+ MP*</td><td>5min/20min</td><td>Tate Student Center</td><td>5: This place is excellent for all your convienence needs, you can almost grocery shop here. 
Get your cold drink fix, frozen meal for tomorrow, and more!</td></tr>
<tr><td>O-House</td><td>Dining Hall</td><td>Breakfast, Homestyle, Grill, Mexican, Mongolian, Deli, Salad Bar</td>
<td>1 Swipe or ~$10 per access</td><td>5min/15min per station</td><td>East Campus</td><td>3.5: The least of the 4 Dining Halls, but still good options. Students recommend the Hibachi station.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Panda Express</td><td>Restaraunt</td><td>Chinese Fast Food: Hot Dishes, Noodles, Appetizers, etc.</td><td>$5-10 MP</td><td>5min/15min</td><td>Tate Student Center</td><td>3.5: 
Loved or hated by students with no in between.  If Chinese Fast Food is your thing, then Panda does not disappoint.  The Spring rolls are decent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Snelling Dining Commons</td><td>Dining Hall</td><td>Homecooked food, Mexican, Grill, Deli, Salad Bar, Italian, Desserts, etc.</td><td>1 Swipe or ~$10 per access</td><td>5min/20min per station</td>
<td>South Campus</td><td>4.5: Arguably the best of the four dining halls.  Snelling has a homey feel and excellent choices from homestyle main-line to pizza or burgers.  The baked goods are delicious!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Starbucks Coffee</td><td>Restaraunt</td><td>Coffee, Baked Goods, Sandwhiches, Snacks</td><td>$5-10 MP</td><td>5min/20min</td><td>Tate Student Center</td>
<td>4.5: Tried and true, Starbucks is a student favorite.  Get your favorite hot or cold custom coffee drink and a snack to go.  The line can be very unruly,
so try to go in betweeen major mealtimes, and use the app to skip the line!</td>
<tr><td>'Tween the Pages Cafe</td><td>Grab-and-go/Cafe</td><td>Pre-made sandwhiches, salads, baked goods, snacks and cold drinks.  Made to order hot sandwhich options</td><td>$5-10+ MP*</td>
<td>5min/10min</td><td>UGA Main Library</td><td>4: Similar (but reduced) options as the Market at Tate.  The premade options are made fresh daily by UGA, and are great to-go choices.  
Not usually crowded, so if you're near the Main Library and want a quick snack, definitely check this place out!</td></tr>
<tr><td>UGA Taco Truck</td><td>Food Truck</td><td>Mexican street food with a twist: tacos, nachos, quesadillas, taco salad, chips and dip, Mexican dessert.</td><td>~$10 MP</td><td>5min/15min</td><td>Main Library/Various locations</td>
<td>5: The UGA Taco Truck is excellent. Try everything. Seriously. It's usually parked outside the Main Library, but moves around from time to time and has been seen
near Tate and at various campus events.  You can even book the Truck to come to your event! A solid choice on any day.</td></tr>

<div class="b"><p><b>Notes about the Table</b></p></div>
<div class="c"><p>Helpful Hints for making use of our reviews!</p></div>
<ul><li>Get the TAPINGO app, as mentioned in the Chick-Fil-A and Starbucks reviews! It's UGA's very own order-ahead app
that lets you skip the lines at most of the restaraunts. </li>
<li>The "Food Served" collumn is overview information. There are many more menu items for each location.</li>
<li>"MP" indicates Meal Plan dollars may be used to purchase food here, "MP*" means you can use 
Meal Plan dollars on only certain items here.</li>
<li>Wait Times are approximate. Do not come after us if you find them to be shorter or longer than listed here.</li>
<li>Review comments are the subjective opinions of the author of this webpage and her friends.  
Do not sue us if you eat at Chick-Fil-A and find it a less than 5-star dining experience...</li></ul>

<div class='figure2'><IMG alt="author" src='author.jpg' width=200p height=200px></div>
<p class ="a"><b>Emma Gough, UGA Sophomore</b></p>
<p>Emma Gough is a second year student in the Terry College of Business studying Accounting & International Business
with a Portuguese Minor. Aside from a certain disposition to flee the country during school holidays, food is one of
Emma's favorite things. She enjoys experimenting with [and subsequently scrutinizing] the dining options at UGA. 
Currently, she works at two different Chick-Fil-A restaraunts where she frequently invents custom chicken concoctions during
her breaks.</p>
<p class="e">When not busy running to all ends of campus in search of the perfect bagel, Emma is probably studying, training, sleeping, or
working in no particular order.  She really does like cooking in her non-existent free time and is in the process of becoming
proficient in basic Brazilian cuisine.  She really does not like coding webpages, and will be avoiding  
this kind of thing in the future.</p>
<div class="box2"><p class="foot">Many thanks to the various contributors to this page (Emma's friends) who kindly 
provided their opinions to be used in the reviews! Hairy Dawg photo courtesy of Hairy Dawg<sup>TM</sup>'s official <a href="http://www.twitter.com/UGAHairyDawg"
